# PENNYJUICE
Redesign website
Original Pennyjuice website : https://www.pennyjuice.com/
In this GitHub repository, you will find a redesign for the juice company Pennyjuice. Pennyjuice is originally a company based in Iowa that creates 100% blended fruit juice concentrates whose target audience is childcare centers. 

Our team decided to create a redesign on a website that wasnt so appealing to the eye and put our creative design into play, we wanted to focus this project on the UX to attract more customers. 

This project is created with React, CSS/SASS and Javascript. Inside this component-based website, we have four pages: the home page, about, products, order, and contact.
Inside the home page, you will find four sections, including a hero with a CTA button that redirects customers to the order page. Next, an area will list the number of flavors with another CTA button redirecting you to the About page. As you scroll down, you will find important information regarding ingredients and FDA approval.

Next, the about page mainly focuses on Pennyjuices values displayed with three sections with images that use a parallax effect.
Then the products page, we decided to add a little pizazz and added a slider that showcases the 15 different flavors that Pennyjuice provides. The order page is inspired by the original order page on the Pennyjuice website, with a form that asks you to provide your information and the different flavors and amount each customer wishes to order. And last, the contact page asks the user for basic information such as first and last name, phone number, email, and any additional comments. Once the submit button is clicked, the data gets sent to the MySQL database created alongside this website.
